            Over the past years, programming languages have transformed the
            world we live in. From websites to applications, all of them use
            diverse programming languages to be created. These languages are
            often defined in terms of their semantics and syntax.&nbsp;

            Hypertext markup language, or HTML, is actually the building block
            of the web that allows experts to build and structure website pages.
            For instance, through HTML, you can utilize elements, like
            paragraphs, headers, and columns, to help structure the content.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            There are some basics that are always included in an HTML document,
            while the rest of the code depends on whatever you want your website
            to look like. Here are some elements:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;head&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;body&gt;</li>

          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            Cascading style sheets, CSS, is a programming language that allows
            you to set the design for the website. You will need to assign
            particular attributes to each HTML element in this sheet. You can
            adjust the font color, size, padding, background color, and other
            aspects to make your website look appealing.&nbsp;

            Another popular programming language is Javascript, but what does
            this language do for website development? Well this programming
            language is used for computations and modifying HTML and CSS code.
            Moreover, it is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted language
            that&apos;s mostly used for PDF files and online applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            As a result, a webpage can include more dynamic and interactive
            elements like dropdown menus, interactive buttons, sliders, and form
            validation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            Every JavaScript code begins with the &lt;script&gt; tag and is
            placed directly into an HTML file. The &lt;/script&gt; tag is used
            to end the code once you&apos;ve completed writing it, signifying
            that the sequence is complete. In this language, functions are
            crucial, and for each function, a name is assigned to make it easy
            to use.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            What sets Javascript apart from other programming languages is,
            hands down, its versatility and functionality for a broad spectrum
            of projects.

            of the most versatile ones that is not just used for creating
            websites and applications but is also incredibly valuable to
            automate regular activities in many organizations.

            It is also employed in data visualization and analysis, and many

            PHP has been quite prevalent for the past few years, and it

            In addition, PHP can also transmit and receive cookies. Popular
            databases like Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL can all be
            integrated with it. Since the community is huge, many tools and
            frameworks are available, and they also provide assistance to
