            is just what the name implies; it&rsquo;s the extensive processing
            of creating a website. Although it can just be creating a page with
            plain text, in this digital era, it entails utilizing complex codes,
            extensive applications, designing, and, finally,
            implementation.&nbsp;

          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            While the process for web development will differ for each project,
            there&rsquo;s a general procedure that begins with planning and
            research. Here is an overview of the process:

            <li className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
              The web developer utilizes programming languages to create the
              front and back end.

            <li className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
              They will then test the website for errors once it&rsquo;s

            <li className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
              If it&rsquo;s good to go, they will prepare it for hosting and
              launch it on the web.

          </ol>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            Website development is all about developers employing various
            technical skills, including problem-solving skills, to produce
            error-free code. Besides that, they also need to possess creativity
            to effectively develop a website that&rsquo;s visually appealing and

            Web development is a diverse field, so developers have the
            opportunity to specialize in various types of development, mainly
            front-end or back-end development. However, an experienced and
            skilled developer will often be competent enough to deal with
            full-stack web development.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            For a better understanding, here are the different types of website
            development.&nbsp;

          </div>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            In front-end website development, developers focus on aspects and
            elements that the user directly sees, such as the visuals. As a
            result, these experts will work on the code of the elements that the
            user will interact with. Since this type of development deals with
            working on user interface (UI) and other elements, it&rsquo;s the
            job of the developer to breathe life into the website design.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            Generally, front-end developers utilize a blend of three programming
            languages, such as:
          </p>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">

          </div>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            HTML or hypertext markup language helps developers structure the
            page and the contents. For instance, the content can be structured
            effectively in paragraphs, numbered lists, bulleted points, etc.,
            with the help of HTML.
          </p>
          <div>
            <ul>

          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are utilized in website development for
            the layout and style of the pages. For instance, CSS will help
            change color, alter, size, and include other decorative elements for
            the web pages.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <div>

          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            Apart from implementing design, these types of developers need to
            test websites and fix existing bugs and errors.&nbsp;

            Back-end development deals with all that goes on behind the scenes
            and is the portion that isn&rsquo;t visible to the users. It
            consists of programming languages, databases, APIs, etc. These
            developers have to make sure the entire website is functioning
            effectively by maintaining the code and database that keeps things
            running.&nbsp;

            Full-stack website development combines both front-end and back-end
            development. Since this entails both ends of developing the website,
            it is often more complicated, and only qualified developers who have
            an understanding of comprehensive programming languages and
            technologies can work on these. As a result, a thorough experience
            of front-end and back-end is required.
