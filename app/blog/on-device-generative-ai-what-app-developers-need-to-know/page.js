            Amongst these various developments, you need to watch out for
            on-device generative AI. These are models of artificial intelligence
            that operate on personal devices, eradicating the necessity for
            consistent cloud communication.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            The cloud-based AI strategy has a few drawbacks for app developers,
            namely latency, cost, security, and privacy. Currently, consumers
            are interested in highly customized and personalized experiences.
            However, they often have to deal with offline constraints and models
            that are data-hungry.&nbsp;

          <p className="text-base text-[#202020] font-normal  md:text-left mb-1">
            This may also restrict the ability to think creatively while
            developing applications that are mobile-friendly and user-focused.
            The goal of on-device generative AI is to tackle these issues
            effectively, providing an opportunity to develop user-focused
            applications.&nbsp;

            Advancements in hardware fuel on-device models; for instance, robust
            mobile processors have specific AI cores that can quickly compute
            intricate models. Unfortunately, that isn&rsquo;t all that&rsquo;s
            needed; model optimization also plays a pivotal role. Therefore,
            experts are striving to create faster models along with other models
            that are already being developed for on-device execution.&nbsp;

            This is to guarantee efficiency and responsiveness even on devices
            that possess a low processing power. That&rsquo;s because such
            developments and models are suitable for simpler tasks. Having said
            that, hybrid techniques, which combine cloud processing and
            on-device, can be a more effective approach for more complicated
            tasks.
